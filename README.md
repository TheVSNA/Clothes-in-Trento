# Clothes-in-Trento
This is a small Android application i did during my third year in Trento that i used to remember which clothes were in my wardrobe in Trento and which not.

To test the application you need to:
* Clone the repository
* Open "App cosa ho a Trento" with Android Studio
* The application was created and tested with API level >= 26 (Android 8.0
